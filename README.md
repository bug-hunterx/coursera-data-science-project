Challenge: Using Satellite Imagery to Predict Food supply


The deadline for this challenge is September 29th 2017

Overview:

Testing to what extent satellite data of greenness can predict subsequent crop price and/or availability.

Basic Information:

Length - estimated total about 30hrs total for someone familiar with data analysis but has not tackled similar projects
Group Size - Any number, but advice is not more the 4 (single person entries welcome)
Difficulty - Intermediate as you are not following well established steps in an existing method
Prerequisite Knowledge - You need to be familiar with a data analysis languages that can analyse images and analyse tabular data.
Required/Recommended Technology - None, beyond your choice of language providing the language can do the steps - So excel is not suitable (even if it could read in images), but R, Python, Matlab, Octave, SAS, or Starta would all be possible. I personally suggest R or Python for being the best languages to showcase your skills in this kind of project, as the web page report deliverable is suited to working with R Rmarkdown files or Python notebooks.
Background

Background/Context - Changes in food availability can dramatic effects markets and entire countries political stability, this project explores to what extent satellite data can indicate coming changes
Target Audience - Commercial organisations interested in food production, NGOs, and governments.
Portfolio Development - This project showcases your ability to take a range of data and determine if it is useful for addressing a question.
Details

Description - This project requires taking the 17 years of weekly greenness data for the 1 or more countries of your choice from the NOAA STAR - Global Vegetation Health Products, Greenness (No Noise NDVI) data set of images from the NOAA website. Match this to your choice of Agricultural production data from the FAO. See if you can find any relationship between the two. Possible steps needed are:
• Download country image data from NOAA

• Download agriculture data from the FAO

• You may need to research what parts of the country your agricultural choice is produced in and find some way to limit the image data to those areas.

• You will need to decide on how you are treating the “greenness” of the image as a measure of agricultural health- for example raw numbers vs seasonal averages over time

• It is possible there could be some kind of lag in time (if there is any link at all) so you may need to play around with time periods.

• You are unlikely to find agricultural data that is in the same time units as the image, so you will need to decide on a plan for dealing with it

• You are going to want some expression of the uncertainty of the results.

Success Criteria - A successful project does not need to find any patterns. The deliverable should be a web page report containing a narrative description of:
• the approach you decided on

• the technologies you used

• the decisions you made about the data and why you chose those paths

• the specific code used in the analysis so others can learn from you (so you must a data analysis language where you write instructions for the analysis)

• an evaluation of the usefulness of the data in relation to the agricultural product you chose

• some expression of the uncertainty of the results in relation to the method you chose

To be awarded a badge, you are going to need to produce the report in English (for marking purposes). But as this is intended to create something showcasing your skills, feel free to produces additional versions in other languages to appeal to your local market.

If working as a team, all members must be acknowledged in the report

Potential Pitfalls:
For people who have not done many original methodology projects, there are going to be times in the project you just need to make a decision about how to approach the data- for example how to treat greenness or how you are identifying relationships. Don’t waste time over it, the key thing for this project is to pick a strategy and explain your reasons.

This web page could be in the form of a blog entry if you have a blog, a GitHub pages site (create a docs folder in a GitHub repo and put the webpage in it, see https://github.com/blog/2228-simpler-github-pages-publishing) or any other webpage publishing service that is publicly available.

Data Access and Usage limitations
Greeness data from NOAA STAR - Global Vegetation Health Products, Greenness (No Noise NDVI)

https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_browseByCountry.php

This is experimental data, so the NOAA make no claim to its accuracy, long term availability, or consistency of calculation.

Agricultural data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization

www.fao.org/faostat/en/

This is publicly available data.

These, and any other resources you employ, should be acknowledged in your report.

We will win for sure.
